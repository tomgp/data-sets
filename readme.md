#Data Sets

When you're learning to visualize data it can be a struggle to find clean data sets. So I've started a small collection here to help get started.

Each set lives in it's own directory with at least a (YAML)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML] file and a .csv or .tsv file.

The focus is on collecting simple tabualar data sets for use with (D3)[https://d3js.org/]

##YAML conventions

I'm using some conventions for fields in the YAML file hopefully they're pretty self explanatory.
`Source`, and `title` are pretty important
```
title:
source:
sourceURL:
dateRetrieved:
datePublished:
dateCollected:
methodology:
```


##Contributing
More data sets sought and welcomed! If you have any data sets you think would fit here you can either fork this repository and make a pull request or if that doesn't make any sense you can get in contact either via this site or (tweet at me)[http://www.twitter.com/tomp]
